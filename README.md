This application is made to help individuals budget themselves. Sometimes budgeting can be difficult. This helps to separate what is gross vs net income to see what you are making and budget those earnings so that you see how much you are spending on everything. Necessities like water, rent/mortgage, also car payments and other must-haves, to subscriptions which are a want. This helps to visualize your income and come up with plans to budget and hopefully be able to save 10 % of your income. Most links that go to other pages of the site work but anything that would need a backend does not such as sign-in and add income or expenses. This is just a overview of the front-end of the site, a skeleton if you will.
